MC simulation  ->  Determine Selection Cuts ->  Skimming  ->  Analysis


=====================
=== MC simulation ===
=====================
multiplicity: determine the multiplicity probability distribution for fireball process


======================
=== Selection Cuts ===
======================
GA: investigate the selection cuts.


================
=== Analysis ===
================
ana_yield.C:
    -list tables for thesis document
    -calculate important quantities like yields, significance, uncertainty of cross section
    -generate the input file for upper limit calculation

significance: calculate the significance and p-values for various b' masses

systematics:  plot the cross section with the consideration of systematic uncertainty

upperlimit:   plot the exclusion plots.
